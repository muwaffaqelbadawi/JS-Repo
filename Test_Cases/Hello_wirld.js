this cource cover all you need to know about html , and the most of the css
after that you can go back to javascript or continue on advance css
you follow this webiste

you dont need to learn all of that okay if you need some thing in project then go and learn and course

most of the w3school css course covered on my course you go to the advance course
and there is also some good youtube courses i will show you

after my course follow traversy media html css course it tech you how to apply your html and css
knowledge on practical applications so this will prepare you to be a front end web developer
okay  after that learn the basic of javascript from w3school and his javascript course  this one

and these 4 videos javascript dom crach course 1,2,3,4 is teching the javascript module to for web applications
there are modern ways to do that using framework for frontend , but you have to learn it okay

after that you can choose between php or javascript for backend developemt using node js
okay  , he also has courses for the two

php front to bck course does not tech the basics of phph  it teches the php library for backnd development okay
this course "Learn Complete Web Development From Scratch" tech  html,css,javascript,php,mysql and
give introduction to framework ,you can foloow the php part or all of it but it is covering
everything , but it will give alot , follow it and the w3school php course okay

this if you want to learn php
or you can lear nodejs insteadof it okay??

ok thank's
but from where i'll get started?
1- follow my web course
2- w3school html and css
3- follow traversy media web course  html css , 1,2,3,5, 6
at this stage you go to learn javascript or continue on html and css

4-w3school javascript
5- traversi media javascript  1,2 ..... 8
6- w3school jquery tutorial
7- traversy media jquery

now you are frontend developer

but after every lesson or  course try to build a =n application using what you have learned okay
8- javascript OOP traversy media

9- php or node js for backend
okay ??

ok right
also i can using python in the backend right?
yes you can use python with the flask or django framework

but to get ajob hre in sudan you have learn php or node . moust required is php
but now days peaple are going to switch to node js development okay ??

ok
so if i want to build an android app i can use these tools for that?
 for mobile applications( android , ios , windows ... ) : -
 there is some requirements
 1- oop javascript and modern javascript called (ES6)
 2- typeScript

 these two you can learn in 3 days

 note * : - in mobile application using javascript they are using javascript frontend framework
 so you have to learn them after the point number 9.

 these framework are (angular , react) they are the most popular
 you have to learn one of them they are also east to learn

 3- one of the javascript mobile apps frameworks
 a- ionic :- this framework using angular, and in current version you use react also
 b- react native :- this one using react
 okay ??

 ok cool
 that's what i want!! but i have to go through all the steps that you give me
 right?

 yes the key point is to learn (html, css, javascript, php or node , frontend framework, backend framework, mobile framework)

 but these make you a full stack developer which means you can build any software application
 and you can apply to any job position (frontend , backend , mobile apps)  any thing get it ??

 ok got it thank you!!

 you are welcome

 and if there is some thing that you do not understand you can search for it on google of youtube ,

 also you can ask me about it okay??
 okay then

 don't take me for ask but is it take too much to learn all these stuff?

 yes it depends on you and how much time you spend on learing

 but do not hurry learn every thing step by step and practice it then go to the next
 and you make it fun by implemnt your own iedas using what you have learned so far

 and the learing process does not stop for a developer until the death ,
 because every day there is a new technology to learn , you  ant learn more advanced thing

 i amcurrently follow some tutorials to learn new things and it will continue okay ??

 ok right like Dr. Abubaker said: the journy of learning doesnt stop and once you stoped
 you'll be dead!!

 so.. thank you so much for your time its plaesure!

 no thank for duty
 one last thing take a break after two or three hours and
 if feel like you dont want learn css today switch to js or practice what you have learn so far

 but never stop learing or practicing okay ? see you later
 ok
 but i wanna know are javascript and node.js they seperateable?
 i mean are they defferent?

 no node js is a "javascript run time enviroment" means a compiler or an interpreter

 but when i say learin nodejs i mean learn the modules that node js provides to us to
 build backend or desktop or mobile
